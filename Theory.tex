\section{PMF Theory}

\iffalse
Observations of Faraday rotation in the polarisation of radio signals reveal the existence of weak coherent magnetic fields over large scales. Magnetic fields have strengths of order microgauss coherent over kPc scales. Similarly the intracluster medium possesses microgauss fields over tens of kPc. In addition, the voids between galaxy clusters are believed to have coherent nanogauss fields.
\\\\
The origin of these fields is not explained in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. [why]. A solution to this problem are seed magnetic fields produced early in the Universe. These seed fields would be amplified through galactic dynamos and magnetohydrodynamics into the magnetic fields we observe in the present day.
\\\\
Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs) are a candidate for the seed magnetic fields. PMFs would have been produced during the early Universe. They may have been a result of conformal symmetry breaking during inflation, or during a phase transition - QCD to weak, say. The Biermann battery is the most standard mechanism for PMF production.
