\section{PMF Theory}

\iffalse
Observations of Faraday rotation in the polarisation of radio signals reveal the existence of weak coherent magnetic fields over large scales. Magnetic fields have strengths of order microgauss coherent over kPc scales. Similarly the intracluster medium possesses microgauss fields over tens of kPc. In addition, the voids between galaxy clusters are believed to have coherent nanogauss fields.
\\\\
The origin of these fields is not explained in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. [why]. A solution to this problem are seed magnetic fields produced early in the Universe. These seed fields would be amplified through galactic dynamos and magnetohydrodynamics into the magnetic fields we observe in the present day.
\\\\
Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs) are a candidate for the seed magnetic fields. PMFs would have been produced during the early Universe. They may have been a result of conformal symmetry breaking during inflation, or during a phase transition - QCD to weak, say. The Biermann battery is the most standard mechanism for PMF production.

\subsection{Biermann Batteries}

The large-scale magnetic fields we see need to have had some initial seed field, but of course this raises the question: Where did the seed field come from? The most popular model for seed magnetic field generation from zero initial conditions is the 'Biermann battery' proposed by Biermann in 1950. Biermann batteries form in highly ionised environments such as the plasma shortly afer the Big Bang. Within the plasma, ions are drawn to regions of lower density and lower temperature. Since the the constituents of the plasma - protons and electrons - have different masses they flow at different rates resulting in a net flow of charge. If this flow of current forms a loop, then by Faraday's law of induction, a magnetic field is produced by the battery.

The magnetic field produced by the Biermann battery is described by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla\times(\vec{U}\times\vec{B}-\eta\nabla \times\vec{B}) - \frac{c k_{b}}{e}\frac{\nabla n_e}{n_e} \times \nabla T
\end{equation}
\\
The final term, $\nabla n_e \times \nabla T$ is the source term describing the Biermann battery effect. In order for this term to be non-zero and hence to have a Biermann battery, gradients of the electron density and the temperature must be non-parallel.

Biermann batteries are also predicted to occur at later times in the Universe

\subsection{Other Methods of PMF Generation}

\subsubsection*{Inflation}
Cosmic inflation is an attactive model for PMF generation. During inflation the Universe isn't yet an ionised plasma. This means that the Universe is not a good conductor.

The rapid expansion of the Universe in this epoch stretches out modes. Inflation stretches out quantum fluctuations into large scale density perturbations which seed the structure of the Universe. Similarly, inflation could stretch out small, weak magnetic fields to megaparsec scales as required.

A problem for this model is that it requires inflation to break conformal symmetry to produce this weak seed field initially. There are many models for how this could work. See X for a list of references.
\subsubsection*{Phase Transitions}
PMFs may have also been produced by early phase transitions, such as the QCD transition or the electroweak phase transition. During a phase transition bubbles of the new phase form within the previous phase, these bubbles grow and collide until the entire Universe reaches the lower phase. These phase transitions bring on non-equilibrium processes such as leptogenesis and baryogenesis, which may be responsible for producing some weak magnetic fields. Within a phase transition, a collision between bubbles will produce turbulence leading to dynamos which will serve to spin up the magnetic fields into the strengths required to match the field strengths observed today.

\subsection{Effect of PMFs on the Cosmic Microwave Background}
If PMFs have a field strength ~1nG then their signatures will be detectable in the CMB B-mode polarisation power spectrum. Just as extragalactic magnetic fields Farday rotate radio and X-ray signals, PMFs would induce Faraday rotation within CMB polarisation. The net effect is that a fraction of E-mode polarisation would be transformed into B-mode polarisation.

The PMF power spectrum is given by:
\begin{equation}
P(k) = A_{PMF}k^{n_B}
\end{equation}
Where $A_{PMF}$ is the PMF amplitude and $n_{B}$ is the PMF spectral index. Since the scale of the PMF power spectrum will depend on the age of the Universe when they first formed, the spectral index is sensitive to the mechanism that first produced PMFs. If $n_{B}$...
In order to measure the strength of PMFs we focus our attention to the amplitude, $A_{PMF}$. The PMF amplitude is related to $B_{1Mpc}$, the strength of PMFs coherent over 1 megaparsec by the following relation:
\begin{equation}
A_{PMF} \propto B_{1Mpc}^4
\end{equation}

\subsection{Other effects of PMFs}

\subsubsection*{Large Scale Structure}


\begin{itemize}
\item large scale structure: $\Omega_8$
\item plot of matter power spectrum for different pmf strengths
\item PMFs interact with charged baryons through Lorentz force
\item interfere with distribution of mass
\item non-linear effect hard to gauge:

\item BBN
\item early energy density budget is modified, expansion rates change
\item freeze-out times for nucleosynthesis change
\item changes in H and He abundances.
\item Weak constraints, Yamazaki in 2012 cites B_1mpc < 1.5 $\mu G$, which isn't very telling.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Other Sources of Cosmic Birefringence}
The rotation of E-mode polarisation to B-mode polarisation is not a phenomenon unique to PMFs. Another mechanism for this effect may be quintessence. Quintessence is an alternative explanation to the cosmological constant for the accelerating expansion of the Universe. It argues that there may exist a long-range pseudoscalar field that can very weakly couple to baryons. The interaction is described by the Chern-Simmons term:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} \propto \frac{\phi}{2M}F_{\mu \nu}\tilde{F}^{\mu \nu}
\end{equation}
\\
Where $\phi$ is the pseudoscalar field and M is the mass of the field boson. If photons couple to this field, then their polarisation will be rotated, just as they would if there were a PMF. The rotation angle due to the pseudoscalar field is given by:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{1}{M} \int{d\eta \dot{\phi}}
\end{equation}
Where $\dot{\phi}$ is integrated over the conformal time $\eta$

Currently we constrain the effects of cosmic birefringence with an equivalent effective PMF, however by comparing the two-point and four-point correlation functions it is possible to differentiate between effects due to PMFs and effects due to conjectured quintessence models. \cite{Ade:2015cao}
